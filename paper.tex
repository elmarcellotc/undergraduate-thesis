\begin{abstract}
    The Economic Complexity has shown an interesting growth 
    as economic theory on the last decade with some focuses
    as public policy, geographical economics, and macroeconomical
    growth. Here, I characterize the ecuadorian industrial and 
    investigative productive networks to model a prognostic of 
    the future industries groth based on the research networks.
